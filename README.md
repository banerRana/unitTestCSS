# unitTestCSS
An effort to higlight the need to unit test CSS, as specificity influences how a design/reuseable component might look while placed inside another container which can lead to long debug efforts.

for more information on specificity in browsers refer:
<li> https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html#specificity
<li> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity

This effort uses yoeman angular generator to set up the environment and uses Karma and PhatomJS plugins to perform the test


The alternative would be to use selenium instead of the headless browser PhantonJS.
